  <h3>What is ionic?</h3>

  
  <p>Ionic Framework is an open source SDK that enables developers to build performant,
     high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). <br>

    Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app.
     This means that it’s not a replacement for Cordova or your favorite JavaScript framework. <br> 
     Instead, Ionic fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: the front-end. <br>
      Check out “Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?” to get a good understanding of Ionic’s core philosophy and goals.</p>
